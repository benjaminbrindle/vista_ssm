# VISTA-SSM: Varying and Irregular Sampling Time-series Analysis via State Space Models

We introduce VISTA, a Python tool based on the method described in _VISTA-SSM: Varying and Irregular Sampling Time-series Analysis via State Space Models_. 

Real world time series data, particularly in the psychological sciences, is often characterized by irregular or ill-structured intervals. This challenge often emerges when exploring temporal data without clear prior categorical information about the subjects in a population. 

VISTA provides a new method for handling these sampling issues while performing unsupervised identification of groups (clustering) in such datasets. Our approach adapts linear Gaussian state space models (LGSSMs) to provide a flexible parametric framework for fitting a wide range of time series dynamics. The clustering approach itself is based on the assumption that the population can be represented as a mixture of a given number of LGSSMs. Each time series is assigned to a cluster with a unique set of parameters, and is assumed to have been generated by the dynamical system:

$$\dot x(t) = Ax(t) + w(t)$$$$y(t) = C x(t) + v(t)$$$$x(0) = \mu + u$$

where the observations are represented by $y(t)$, $x(t)$ is an unobserved latent variable, $u$, $v(t)$, and $w(t)$ are Gaussian noise, and $A$ and $C$ are matrices. The algorithmic structure of VISTA is sketched in the below schematic, with readers encouraged to reference our paper for more technical details and derivations.

We hope that VISTA will be an accessible and valuable tool for researchers to handle the challenges of healthcare and mental health data.

## Installation 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:benjaminbrindle/vista_ssm.git
pip install -e vista_ssm
```

## Usage

We have compiled a number of useful helper functions to interface directly with the VISTA algorithm, which was inspired by (Umatani et al., 2023)[^1]. For instance, one can run the VISTA algorithm by simply running the function:
```
runVISTA(how,param_dic,dataset,time_points,**kwargs):
    """helper function to run EMLGSSM algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    how: string
        which method to use for initializing the parameters:
            random: chooses random parameters within a specific range
            ident: chooses parameters as identity matrices or close to them
            kmeans: uses kmeans on the data to choose parameters
    param_dic: dic
        parameters used:
            DIM_X - dimension of latent variable
            DIM_Y - dimension (number of features) of observation
            N_CLUSTER - number of clusters
            NUM_CPU - number of CPUs to run on
            FIX - list of parameters to be fixed throughout algorithm
            NUM_LGSSM - number of lgssms to use in kmeans initialization for each time series
            MAX_ITER - maximum number of iterations to run algorithm before termination
            EPSILON - stopping tolerance used to evaluate absolute difference among parameters between steps
            BIC - bool of whether or not to return information criteria
            
    dataset: ndarray(n_samples,n_time,dim_y,1)

    time_points: ndarray(n_samples,n_time)
        times corresponding to each observation in dataset

    Returns
    -------
    dic
        dictionary of results:
            parameter - final parameters of misture of LGSSMs
            label - cluster memberships of each time series
"""
```

To illustrate this with a concrete example, we run the following code:
```
import numpy as np
from vista_ssm import vista_ssm_Funcs as vista
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.rcParams['figure.dpi']=600
data=np.array([np.array([[[0]],[[0.5]],[[0.8]]]),np.array([[[1]],[[.9]],[[.8]],[[0.7]]])],dtype=object)
tp=np.array([np.array([0,0.3,0.8]),np.array([0,0.1,0.3,1])],dtype=object)
param_dic={'DIM_X': 2,
           'DIM_Y': 1,
           'NUM_DATA': 2,
           'N_CLUSTER' : 2,
           'NUM_CPU' : 1,
           'FIX' : [],
           'NUM_LGSSM' : 30,
           'MAX_ITER' : 1000,
           'EPSILON' : 0.1,
           'BIC' : True}
result=vista.runVISTA('random',param_dic,data,tp)
vista.predicted_trajectories(result['parameter'],data,result['label'],30,plotcolor=(plt.cm.winter,0,0.8,0.3),timepoints=tp)
```
Which returns the number of iterations until the stopping tolerance was achieved and a plot of the data against the fitted LGSSMs.

Within the experiments folder we provide several Jupyter notebooks showcasing VISTA and demonstrating its ease of use in practical settings. In the data folder we have collected the open-source datasets used in our panel[^2], epidemiological[^3], and ecological momentary assessment[^4] data examples for ease of reproducibility. We have compiled our results from running VISTA on each of these datasets in the results folder.
